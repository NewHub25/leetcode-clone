# LeetClone

## Description

LeetClone is a self-directed learning project focused on building a LeetCode clone using modern web technologies. The primary purpose is to gain hands-on experience with React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase, creating an efficient and interactive coding challenges platform.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Implement a secure authentication system using Firebase Authentication to allow users to create accounts, log in, and track their progress.

- **Coding Challenges:** Provide a diverse collection of coding challenges with varying difficulty levels, creating a comprehensive set similar to LeetCode.

- **Code Editor Integration:** Seamless integration of a code editor, such as Monaco Editor, enabling users to solve coding challenges directly within the platform.

- **Real-time Evaluation:** Implement a real-time code evaluation system using Firebase Cloud Functions to provide instant feedback on user-submitted solutions.

- **User Profile:** Create user profiles with Firebase Firestore to showcase achievements, completed challenges, and overall progress.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Build the user interface and manage the application's state efficiently.

- **Next.js:** Leverage the power of Next.js for server-side rendering, routing, and optimizing the application for production.

- **TypeScript:** Enhance code maintainability and developer experience by using TypeScript for static typing.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Utilize a utility-first CSS framework to rapidly style the user interface and maintain a clean, responsive design.

- **Firebase:** Leverage Firebase services, including Authentication for user management and Firestore for real-time database storage.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/NewHub25/leetcode-clone`
2. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
3. **Configure Firebase settings:** Set up authentication and Firestore.
4. **Run the development server:** `npm run dev`
5. **Access the application:** Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Roadmap

- **Version 1.0.0:** Basic functionality with user authentication, coding challenges, and real-time evaluation.

- **Version 2.0.0:** Enhanced user profiles, leaderboards, and additional features for a richer user experience.

- **Future Updates:** Regularly update the platform with new challenges, improvements, and community-driven features.
